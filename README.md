Password Strength Analysis
Password Strength Analysis is a tool that analyzes passwords and rates their strength using multiple checks (length, character variety, dictionary checks, entropy estimate, common patterns). It’s useful for teaching users how to create stronger passwords and for integrating password checks into projects (signup forms, security audits).

Features
Rates a password on a 0–100 scale and gives a human-readable label (Very Weak → Excellent).

Checks:
Length requirement
Character variety (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols)
Common dictionary words and top breached passwords
Repeated characters or simple sequences (e.g., aaaa, 12345, qwerty)
Leaked/breached password check (optional — via user-supplied list or API)
Gives constructive suggestions to improve the password.


Algorithm / How it works
Basic checks: length, presence of lowercase/uppercase/digits/symbols.
Character variety: reward for mixing character classes.
Dictionary & common password check: compare against a top-100k password list and common English words (detect substitutions like @ -> a, 0 -> o).
Pattern detection: detect sequences (abcd, 1234), repeats (aaaa), keyboard patterns (qwerty).
Entropy estimate: compute estimated bits of entropy based on character set and length, adjusted for patterns.
Scoring: combine sub-scores (length, variety, dictionary penalty, entropy) into a normalized 0–100 score.
Suggestions: produce targeted advice (e.g., “add 4 symbols”, “remove common word”) based on which checks failed.


Scoring & Output
Score: 0–100 (higher is stronger).
Rating buckets (example):
0–20: Very Weak
21–40: Weak
41–60: Moderate
61–80: Strong
81–100: Excellent


Conclusion
The Password Strength Analysis project demonstrates how simple checks, pattern detection, and entropy estimation can help users understand the strength of their passwords. By identifying weaknesses such as dictionary words, predictable sequences, and short lengths, the tool provides clear feedback and actionable suggestions for creating stronger credentials.

This project highlights the importance of awareness in cybersecurity — most breaches exploit weak or reused passwords. With this analysis system, users and developers can promote better password hygiene and integrate automated checks into applications for improved security.

Future improvements, such as integrating with breach databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned) or adding advanced machine learning models, can make the system even more reliable. Overall, the project emphasizes that strong, unique, and unpredictable passwords are the first line of defense in protecting digital identities.
